My PC flushed everything and i was only able to recover every bit of my work yesterday since evrything was in it and i couldn't back it up on my other devices like my cellphone but i understand i am  a week late and didn't report my issue to the class representative , so sir isn't there something that can be done? 


I came to your office today to day and you were not there, surely there is something we can do sir but I understand,  I was irresponsible I should have told the class representatives regarding my issue and I didn't,  but please sir maybe we can work something out
